## Process improvement method
Would like to use Scrum's method below

Key elements of the sprint retrospective:
Process improvements are made at the end of every sprint. This ensures that the project team is always improving the way it works.
- The retrospective is a collaborative process among all members, including the team, the product owner, and the ScrumMaster.
- All team members identify what went well and what could be improved.
- The team members discuss the process that they are following and give any suggestions for improvement.
- The team members discuss any other ideas that could improve their productivity.
- The ScrumMaster prioritizes actions and lessons learned based on team direction.
- The retrospective supports team formation and bonding, particularly as any areas of conflict can be identified and dealt with.
- The retrospective helps build the team's sense of ownership and its self-management.
