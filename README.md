## Process improvement method
Would like to use Scrum's method (https://github.com/shanghai-machine-learning-meetup/meetup_wiki/wiki/Scrum-process-improvement-method)

- All team members identify what went well and what could be improved.
- The team members discuss the process that they are following and give any suggestions for improvement.
- The team members discuss any other ideas that could improve their productivity.
- The ScrumMaster prioritizes actions and lessons learned based on team direction.

## Current event activity
